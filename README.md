# My Portfolio
My Carnegie Mellon University "Telling Stories With Data" portfolio demonstrates my expertise in data wrangling, visualization techniques (Tableau, Shorthand), and crafting compelling narratives. My work, including a Final Project, provides a comprehensive showcase of how I can transform complex data into clear and impactful stories. I'm eager to apply this experience to solve your organization's unique data challenges.
