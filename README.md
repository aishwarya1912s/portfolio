  # My Portfolio
  </div>

My Carnegie Mellon University "Telling Stories With Data" portfolio demonstrates my expertise in data wrangling, visualization techniques (Tableau, Shorthand), and crafting compelling narratives. My work, including a Final Project, provides a comprehensive showcase of how I can transform complex data into clear and impactful stories. I'm eager to apply this experience to solve your organization's unique data challenges.

My name is Aishwarya Singtamkar(she/her) and I am a current Masterâ€™s student at Carnegie Mellon University. I am pursuing a degree in the Information Systems Management (MISM) track here. I am improving my skills in Data Visualization, Storytelling with data, drawing insights, envisioning solution designs for a problem by studying the course Telling Stories with Data. I am interested in Product Management roles and I am confident that these skills will help me do justice to the role. My email id is asingtam@andrew.cmu.edu and I look forward to connecting with you here.

**1. Expertise in data visualization and storytelling:**
I'm particularly interested in refining my ability to visually represent data in a way that is not only clear, but also engaging and impactful for diverse audiences.

**2. Advanced skills in drawing insights from data:**
This involves honing my ability to not only analyze data but also identify significant patterns, relationships, and trends that can be used to inform decision-making and problem-solving.

**3. A strong foundation in solution design:**
By studying "Telling Stories with Data," I hope to learn effective frameworks and methodologies for translating data insights into actionable solutions, considering various user needs and potential challenges.

 <br>  <br>
[final project part II](https://aishwarya1912s.github.io/portfolio/final-project-part-two.html)

 <br>  <br>


In this project, by analyzing data, I seek to understand how reading habits correlate with mental health indicators and explore the mechanisms through which reading can positively influence emotional and psychological wellness. I will look at how bibliotherapy (a creative arts therapy that involves storytelling or the reading of specific texts) can be useful in addressing our wellness. Drawing a correlation between reading habits and mental health outcomes, I will highlight the potential of literature as a therapeutic tool for enhancing emotional well-being.
