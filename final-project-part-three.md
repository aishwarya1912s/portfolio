Bibliotherapy: Read your way to wellness

# Changes made since Part II
After obtaining Feedback from the user research, interviews and the Professor and TA, I have made the following changes to my Story when finalizing my Story flow in Shorthand ,based on :-

Professor and TA’s Feedback:- 

1. Refined the story to focus on general benefits of reading (mainly as an additional therapeutic tool for mental health issues) rather than a direct remedy to mental health disorders.

2. Added more specific titles to better explain the story visualizations.

3. Added a very clear Call to Action page, which focused on general benefits from starting reading rather than as it being a remedy to any particular mental health disorder.

4. Added a warning in the end that specified that this is not medical advice for mental health disorders, in which case, consulting a trained medical professional is important.

User Research feedback:-

1. Moved the brief overview of what Bibliotherapy is about to later on in the screens, instead of immediately at the beginning.

2. Elaborated more on describing mental health disorders and some statistics.

3. Added a pie chart that gave students' responses to surveys about whether their college has wellness support.

4. Additionally, based on in-class critique, I made sure to add some more written explanation for what Bibliotherapy is and hence, dedicated an entire page to its description.

5. To ensure visual consistency, I meticulously maintained uniformity in images, fonts, titles, and visualizations throughout my portfolio. 

6. I also made sure I cited all the content that was not cited to avoid any copyright issues.

I also added more text explaining the studies related to the visualizations since everyone asked for more information to better understand it. Additionally, I proofread for grammatical errors and ensured the proper rendering of both all the visualizations.


## The audience
Target Audience: University students aged 18-25, experiencing academic pressure, stress, and potentially mental health challenges.

As a student myself, I’ve seen firsthand the toll that stress, competition, and uncertainty can take on mental well-being. Traditional solutions like therapy often face barriers of cost, stigma, or limited availability. That’s why I’m passionate about exploring Bibliotherapy – the power of reading to heal and empower. It’s accessible, affordable, and can offer comfort, coping mechanisms, and even inspiration. Hence, I looked at University students to be my target audience.

When I started wireframing my Story I was looking at targeting very specifically the students at universities who are afflicted with a mental health disorder, and planned to suggest Reading almost as a solution to it. However, as I spoke with more users and took Feedback from reviewers I realized there was a more broader scope possible. Also, exploration of more explanatory text for the survey studies led me to more surveys and research papers that looked at reading as simply a well-being benefit rather than just as a targeted mental health remedy.
This was a huge turning point as now I looked at Bibliotherapy as a tool to be integrated into everyone’s life, not just those suffering from an issue. This greatly influenced my Story design and flow.

By targeting my project towards students, I hoped to equip them with tools to manage their stress  or even any mental health issues, and thrive in their academic journey. Although, while the primary focus is college students, the information on Bibliotherapy can be relevant to anyone who is interested in mental well-being pursuit.  Even user groups like university administrators and mental health professionals can also be possible audiences to my story. University staff can promote awareness and access, while professionals could integrate Bibliotherapy into their treatment plans.

Ultimately, I believed Bibliotherapy could be a powerful weapon for well-being for almost anyone and everyone.
