Bibliotherapy: Read your way to wellness

# Changes made since Part II
After obtaining Feedback from the user research, interviews and the Professor and TA, I have made the following changes to my Story when finalizing my Story flow in Shorthand ,based on :-

Professor and TA’s Feedback:- 

1. Refined the story to focus on general benefits of reading (mainly as an additional therapeutic tool for mental health issues) rather than a direct remedy to mental health disorders.

2. Added more specific titles to better explain the story visualizations.

3. Added a very clear Call to Action page, which focused on general benefits from starting reading rather than as it being a remedy to any particular mental health disorder.

4. Added a warning in the end that specified that this is not medical advice for mental health disorders, in which case, consulting a trained medical professional is important.

User Research feedback:-

1. Moved the brief overview of what Bibliotherapy is about to later on in the screens, instead of immediately at the beginning.

2. Elaborated more on describing mental health disorders and some statistics.

3. Added a pie chart that gave students' responses to surveys about whether their college has wellness support.

4. Additionally, based on in-class critique, I made sure to add some more written explanation for what Bibliotherapy is and hence, dedicated an entire page to its description.

5. To ensure visual consistency, I meticulously maintained uniformity in images, fonts, titles, and visualizations throughout my portfolio. 

6. I also made sure I cited all the content that was not cited to avoid any copyright issues.

I also added more text explaining the studies related to the visualizations since everyone asked for more information to better understand it. Additionally, I proofread for grammatical errors and ensured the proper rendering of both all the visualizations.


## The audience
Target Audience: University students aged 18-25, experiencing academic pressure, stress, and potentially mental health challenges.

As a student myself, I’ve seen firsthand the toll that stress, competition, and uncertainty can take on mental well-being. Traditional solutions like therapy often face barriers of cost, stigma, or limited availability. That’s why I’m passionate about exploring Bibliotherapy – the power of reading to heal and empower. It’s accessible, affordable, and can offer comfort, coping mechanisms, and even inspiration. Hence, I looked at University students to be my target audience.

When I started wireframing my Story I was looking at targeting very specifically the students at universities who are afflicted with a mental health disorder, and planned to suggest Reading almost as a solution to it. However, as I spoke with more users and took Feedback from reviewers I realized there was a more broader scope possible. Also, exploration of more explanatory text for the survey studies led me to more surveys and research papers that looked at reading as simply a well-being benefit rather than just as a targeted mental health remedy.
This was a huge turning point as now I looked at Bibliotherapy as a tool to be integrated into everyone’s life, not just those suffering from an issue. This greatly influenced my Story design and flow.

By targeting my project towards students, I hoped to equip them with tools to manage their stress  or even any mental health issues, and thrive in their academic journey. Although, while the primary focus is college students, the information on Bibliotherapy can be relevant to anyone who is interested in mental well-being pursuit.  Even user groups like university administrators and mental health professionals can also be possible audiences to my story. University staff can promote awareness and access, while professionals could integrate Bibliotherapy into their treatment plans.

Ultimately, I believed Bibliotherapy could be a powerful weapon for well-being for almost anyone and everyone.


## References
I have already added the entire comprehensive list of references for all my sources to my Shorthand story, in the very end. 
To build my Story I have used a mix of datasets (cited in ALA format) from the Open Source website figshare and a mix of other sites hosting research papers for the studies. I have also used Gemini to reframe some of my textual content appropriately. The SAMHSA and WHO websites have also been immensely helpful in my Story drafting journey.


# Final thoughts
I really loved working on this project and felt quite satisfied with the result. Apart from helping me broaden my view of Reading as a tool to well-being as a whole, I learnt a lot of new visualization techniques and perspectives. User research with multiple perspectives was a huge help here, that helped push me in newer directions. It was very interesting to me how intervention costs for Bibliotherapy were as low as $14, something I definitely did not know before. Working with Shorthand for the first time was really convenient and interesting. It was very simple to keep adding pages to my story using its templates as a guiding force.

However, unfortunately, I also ran out of time in pursuing some of my ideas for the Story. I wanted to also include a visualization depicting majority user preference in the genre that readers pursue but did not have enough time. Additionally, in the future I would like to look up more research papers related to the effects of Bibliography and build a Story from their findings. Another avenue I would like to consider pursuing is looking at other benefits that Bibliotherapy has on a human being, apart from mental health or general well-being. Would it help readers read faster, better? Would it improve cognition and affect the financial status of a person, open up more doors? These are some questions I have.

Specific to the Feedback I received, though many found the Word Cloud a little tough to understand, I felt it was relevant to include in the Story as it conveyed the major challenge college students faced to accessible mental care. I explored trying different visualizations for it but since the data consisted of descriptive and open-ended answers in response to the survey questions, it was difficult to highlight the frequency of ‘Financial Support’ appearing all through the responses, in any other format. I really wanted to highlight that and hence used a Word Cloud and used the red coloured font to draw attention to it.

Additionally, when I looked at other instances Bibliotherapy was useful, improved behavioral changes in Dementia patients came up. This greatly intrigued me and hence I included a visualization for it towards the end, in the Story.

A major challenge in doing this project was locating free and open source datasets that I could use for my data visualization freely. Very few sites had complete and free datasets visible to the public. Also, finding specific datasets that pertained to my topic was difficult. There were many datasets I found that simply contained a distribution of what books the participants read or the different genres of books. However, not many included Bibliotherapy as an influential influence on it. However, the figshare website was most helpful here.

In the end, as I reflected on my learnings from this project and the course as a whole, I felt that  this course, although demanding, proved invaluable. I learnt to work with many new tools that I had not worked with before, the most notable among them being Tableau and also, Shorthand. I had always been very keen to learn to work with Tableau before this class and it was nice to do so in this class. The 'Telling Stories with Data' approach and the guidance of my professor will undoubtedly remain deeply embedded in my mind  as I navigate future data analysis projects in my career.
