# Wireframes / storyboards
> After collecting relevant data to support my idea in Part 1, now, in Part 2 I worked on implementing a high fidelity outline of what I want my story to be like. The objective was to run it by a few interviewees and receive feedback to build on for my final part of the project. To create visualizations of the critical elements of the project I have used Tableau and aim to use Shorthand to compile all the elements together into one compelling story.


Please follow along below to my story outline:-


 First, I will start off with a cover page that's titled “ Bibliotherapy:Read your way to wellness”.
The idea is to give the reader a starting point to figure out what my story is about.

 Next, I will give the reader a brief overview of what Bibliotherapy is about. I will also talk about the plethora of mental health disorders that plague the people in the world today.

 The subsequent page will introduce the reader to my target audience- the students at Universities. It is a well-known fact that students in this day and age face one of the most intense pressures to succeed in this competitive world. This leads to multiple mental health issues. 

 Next, the reader will view some of my Tableau creations. They should be pretty self-explanatory but I have added appropriate labels to aid the user wherever necessary.

> The reader will next view a 'Call to Action' page on Shorthand that will encourage the studnets to seek help if they are suffering with any mental disorders. It will re-iterate the ease and cost-effectiveness of Bibliotherapy as a treatment option to deal with it. I will also list out some resources or events occuring nearby or in the recent future, that the studnets might like to check out.



# User research 

## Target audience

My project, "Bibliotherapy: Read your way to wellness," is on a mission to help university students like myself navigate the pressures and anxieties of college life. As a student myself, I've seen firsthand the toll that stress, competition, and uncertainty can take on mental well-being. Traditional solutions like therapy often face barriers of cost, stigma, or limited availability. That's why I'm passionate about exploring Bibliotherapy – the power of reading to heal and empower. It's accessible, affordable, and can offer comfort, coping mechanisms, and even inspiration. 

By targeting my project towards students, I hope to equip them with alternative tools to manage their mental health and thrive in their academic journey. Ultimately, I believe Bibliotherapy can be a powerful weapon in our collective fight for student well-being. Hence, my target audience will be an average college student.

Additionally, while the primary focus is college students, the information on Bibliotherapy can be relevant to anyone interested in mental well-being and alternative treatment options. User groups like  university administrators and mental health professionals can also be possible audiences to my story. University staff can promote awareness and access, while professionals could integrate Bibliotherapy into their treatment plans. 

When I look at identifying possible subjects to test my story outline on, I have decided to reach out to three varied types of people for maximum inclusivity and coverage - 

1. A high achieving Student:-
Someone who is a departmental high achiever or someone consistently on the Dean's List.
Why? The aim is to explore their experiences with academic stress, perfectionism, competition, and future anxieties. I will ask about their current strategies for managing stress and maintaining mental well-being. They will be good user targets to gauge their potential interest in using reading as a mental health tool.

2. A student openly struggling with Mental Health:-
Someone who openly discusses mental health challenges like anxiety, depression, or academic burnout. 
Why? This subgroup will have a diverse perspective as they will have already been looking at different mechanisms to approach their mental health treatment. They can help me with their insights on traditional mental health services, if any, and the barriers they faced. I can gauge how open they are to trying out Bibliotherapy as a possible alternative.

3. A randomly selected student:
Someone from a different academic discipline, ethnicity or socio-economic background.
Why? This subgroup will help give a neutral approach to the topic. They will add diverse perspectives to the approach and might end up throwing up a very interesting new idea. I can explore their overall perceptions of student life, mental health awareness, and stress management. The questions for them will be pretty open-ended.

To satisfy this criteria, I have chosen a mix of 3 such students from CMU and Columbia University. The interviews were condcuted either over Zoom or in-person.


## Interview script

> Target Audience: University students aged 18-25, experiencing academic pressure, stress, and potentially mental health challenges.

As a framework to design my interview questions, I aim to refer to Stephen Few’s Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile. Stephen talks of 2 broad categories with a few more sub-categories. I aim to keep these categories as the goals I wish to achieve and draft out my questions in line to them.

Accordingly, my interview questions will be:- 

 (Introduction, consent, warm-up questions)

A. Informative:-

1. Usefulness:
Which specific data visualization resonated with you the most ?
What information did you learn from these visualizations?
Do you think the current visualizations convey all the necessary information effectively?
Are there any missing data points or insights that could be added?
Did you find the story useful to incorporate into your life?

2. Perceptibility:
How easy is it for you to understand the data represented in my visualizations?
Which elements of the visualizations seem clear and effective?
Are there any confusing elements or visual clutter that needs to be addressed?

3.Truthfulness:
How confident are you in the accuracy of the data represented in these visualizations?
Do you think any of these might have a bias?
Would you believe in the insights drawn from these visualizations?

4. Intuitiveness
How easily were you able to navigate and explore these visualizations?
Was the story flow and design layout intuitive?
Was any particular visualization difficult to understand?

B. Emotive:-

1. Aesthetics:
What is your overall impression of the visual design and aesthetics of the visualizations?
Do you think the color scheme, fonts, and layout are effective and appealing?
Are there any visual elements that seem distracting or out of place?
Any suggestions to improve the aesthetics?

2. Engagement:
What elements of the visualizations captured your immediate and prolonged attention?
Was the story interesting?
Any suggestions to make the story more engaging?


## Interview findings

The interviews were conducted in a mix of virtually and in person. Each discussion lasted approximately 20 minutes. The resultant findings were:

Interview 1:
The interviewee liked the ‘Distribution of mental disorders awareness in students’ heat map the most. Found the colors calming and the design not too cluttered. He did not like the word cloud as he felt it was messy. Did not fully understand the significance of it without me explaining it to him. He liked the 2 bar charts as he found them well structured and simple to understand. Again, he did not like the line graph much but accepted the point when I explained it to him. Did not understand some of the terms like Functioning CORE etc.
Overall, he liked the idea of the story but wanted to see more explanation for all of it. Felt that more details about the exact method of Bibliotherapy might help understand. He was willing to accept the accuracy and truthfulness of the story but only once I explained a bit more about Bibliotherapy to him.

Interview 2:
This interviewee was initially quite confused about what the charts were saying. She was more focussed on the visual aspect of it than trying to read the accompanying explanation.  However, once she focussed properly on the flow, she liked the idea. Felt it was a novel and cool story idea. She asked why there was so much red in the word cloud. She did not understand the line graphs very well. Did not understand what the 5 treatments mentioned there were about.
Overall, she liked the idea but wasn’t sure of the reliability without seeing some citations or data tables. She was unwilling to trust only the visualizations on their own.

Interview 3:
This interview was focussed a lot more on the visual aspects rather than the story. He was more interested in looking at the different colors, fonts and the charts created in the visualizations. He liked the variety of visualizations present. But he wanted a different color for the ‘Bibliotherapy’ bar in the 2 bar charts. Suggested that might draw better attention to it. He felt the line graph was a little distracting due to the sharp turns on the chart. But he liked the red and green colors used in the charts to denote before and after. Suggested that more generic images of people reading books might help to increase visual appeal in the story. He liked the Dementia patient chart but felt it did not add much value. He also suggested that maybe a survey of how many students knew about or had a wellness programme at their college would be an interesting thing to know. Also, he did not fully know the meaning of some of the terms in the charts like CORE, Comet and COPE.
